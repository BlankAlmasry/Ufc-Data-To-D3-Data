# Ufc-Data-To-D3-Data

Just a script to convert the data from the Ufc-Scrapper repository to a format that is easier to work with my
Rating-Algorithms-Visualizer.

Kinda special, because it's a script. wasn't designed to be reused

## Usage

Must have csv file in format of
`name1, name2, result1, result2, data(yyyy-mm-dd))`

`py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

`py main.py path-to-csv-file`

data will be generated in data folder

I left fights.csv file which is a real example based on all UFC fights
